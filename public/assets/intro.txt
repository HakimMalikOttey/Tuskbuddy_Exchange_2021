Welcome friends and fans to the eighth annual Tuskbuddy Exchange, a massive collaboration event that focuses entirely on drawing Orcs. Here are the results for Orctober 2021.
<p>
Participants were invited to submit sketches of original orc characters, which would then be shuffled around and redistributed to different artists to be finished off in whatever way they wished. 
<p>
The end result is that this year, we've added 130 Orc drawings to the internet. Even without the Tuskbuddy Exchange, the Orctober phenomenon is expanding, with dozens of past participants and skilled artists from across the internet all independently drawing orcs all month long!
<p>
It's a great opportunity to experiment, to explore other artist's styles and ideas, and to pay homage to some of our favorite subject matter.

A big thank you to everybody who participated this year, and especially to everybody who really went above and beyond.
